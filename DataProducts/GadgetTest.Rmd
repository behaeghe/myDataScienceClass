## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, collapse=TRUE,tidy=TRUE}
library(shiny)
library(miniUI)

pickXY <- function(data_frame) {
        ui <- miniPage(
                gadgetTitleBar("Select Points by Dragging your Mouse"),
                miniContentPanel(
                        plotOutput("plot", height = "100%", brush = "brush")
                )
        )
        
        server <- function(input, output, session) {
                output$plot <- renderPlot({
                        plot(data_frame$X, data_frame$Y, main = "Plot of Y versus X",
                             xlab = "X", ylab = "Y")
                })
                observeEvent(input$done, {
                        stopApp(brushedPoints(data_frame, input$brush,
                                              xvar = "X", yvar = "Y"))
                })
        }
        
        runGadget(ui, server)
}

my_data <- data.frame(X = rnorm(100), Y = rnorm(100))

pickXY(my_data)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
